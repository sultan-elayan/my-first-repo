# Object-Oriented Programming, HTML Tables
## Domain Modeling
> Domain modeling is the process of creating a conceptual model in code for a specific problem. A model describes the various entities, their attributes and behaviors, as well as the constraints that govern the problem domain. An entity that stores data in properties and encapsulates behaviors in methods is commonly referred to as an object-oriented model.
### Generate random numbers
_To model the random nature of user behavior, you'll need the help of a random number generator. Fortunately, the JavaScript standard library includes a Math.random() function for just this sort of occasion._

## HTML Tables
### What's a Table?
> A table represents information in a grid format.
Examples of tables include financial reports, TV
schedules, and sports results.

### Basic Table St ructure
- ### (table)
> The (table) element is used
to create a table. The contents
of the table are written out row
by row.

- ### (tr)
> You indicate the start of each
row using the opening (tr) tag.
(The tr stands for table row.)

- ### (td)
> Each cell of a table is
represented using a (td)
element. (The td stands for
table data.)

- ### (th)
> The (th) element is used just
like the (td) element but its
purpose is to represent the
heading for either a column or
a row. (The th stands for table
heading.)

## Object Oriented Programming
### CREATING MANY OBJECTS:CONSTRUCTOR NOTATION
> Sometimes you will want several objects to represent similar things.
Object constructors can use a function as a template for creating objects.
First, create the template with the object's properties and methods.

### CREATING OBJECTS USING CONSTRUCTOR SYNTAX
> On the right, an empty object
called hote 1 is created using the
constructor function.

### CREATE & ACCESS OBJECTS CONSTRUCTOR NOTATION
> To get a better idea of why you
might want to create mult iple
objects on the same page, here
is an example that shows room
availability in two hotels.

### ADDING AND REMOVING PROPERTIES
> Once you have created an object
(using literal or constructor
notation), you can add new
properties to it.

### THE DOCUMENT OBJECT MODEL: THE DOCUMENT OBJECT
> The topmost object in the Document Object Model (or DOM) is the
document object. It represents the web page loaded into the current
browser window or tab.

### DATA TYPES REVISITED
### 1. String
### 2. Number
### 3. Boolean
### 4. Undefined
### 5. Null
### 6. Object
