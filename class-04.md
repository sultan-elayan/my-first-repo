# HTML Links, JS Functions & CSS Layout
## HTML Links 
> Links are the defining feature of the web
because they allow you to move from
one web page to another — enabling the
very idea of browsing or surfing.

**You will commonly come across the following types of links:**

- Links from one website to another
- Links from one page to another on the same website
- Links from one part of a web page to another part of the
same page
- Links that open in a new browser window
- Links that start up your email program and address a new
email to someone

## CSS Layout
> CSS page layout techniques allow us to take elements contained in a web page and control where they are positioned relative to their default position in normal layout flow, the other elements around them, their parent container, or the main viewport/window.

**CSS Layout technique**

1. Normal flow
2. The display property
3. Flexbox
4. Grid
5. Floats
6. Positioning
7. Table layout
8. Multiple-column layout

## Functions, Methods, and Objects in JAVASCRIPT
> A method is a function associated with an object, or, put differently, a method is a property of an object that is a function. Methods are defined the way normal functions are defined, except that they have to be assigned as the property of an object.

**JavaScript Functions**
_A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task.
A JavaScript function is executed when "something" invokes it (calls it)._

> A JavaScript function is defined with the function keyword, followed by a name, followed by parentheses ().

> Function names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs (same rules as variables).

> The parentheses may include parameter names separated by commas:
(parameter1, parameter2, ...)

> The code to be executed, by the function, is placed inside curly brackets: {}

### Function Declarations vs. Function Expressions

> A declared function is “saved for later use”, and will be executed later, when it is invoked (called).
> Function declarations load before any code is executed while Function expressions load only when the interpreter reaches that line of code.

> After a function expression has been stored in a variable, the variable can be used as a function. Functions stored in variables do not need function names. They are always invoked (called) using the variable name.
