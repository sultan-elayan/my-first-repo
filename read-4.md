# Data Modeling

## Name 3 advantages to Test Driven Development 

> 1. You are able to identify the errors and problems quickly.
> 2. You receive fast feedback.
> 3. Bugs are reduced.

## What is a Test Suite? 
> Test suite is a container that has a set of tests which helps testers in executing and reporting the test execution status. It can take any of the three states namely Active, Inprogress and completed.

## In what case would you need to use beforeEach() or afterEach() in a test suite? 

> Often while writing tests you have some setup work that needs to happen before tests run, and you have some finishing work that needs to happen after tests run. Jest provides helper functions to handle this.

## What is one downside of Test Driven Development 

> disadvantage is that the same as before when writing code that apparently takes an extended time. 

## disadvantage is that the same as before when writing code that apparently takes an extended time. 

> -  A Constructor is a block of code that initializes a newly created object. 

> - A class is - think of a blueprint - a blueprint in architecture or engineering otherwise is used to create a building or device. In Object Oriented Programming

## Why REST? 

> - REST aims to make caching easier. Since the server is stateless and each request can be processed individually, GET requests should usually return the same response regardless of previous ones and the session.

> - This makes the GET requests easily cashable and browsers usually treat them as such. We can also make our POST requests cashable using Cache-Control and Expires headers.

| Syntax      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| functional programming | Functional programming languages are specially designed to handle symbolic computation and list processing applications. Functional programming is based on mathematical functions.    |
| object-oriented programming (OOP)  | Object-oriented programming is based on the concept of objects. In object-oriented programming data structures, or objects are defined, each with its own properties or attributes.    |
| class  | Classes are a template for creating objects. They encapsulate data with code to work on that data.     |
| super  | Definition and Usage. The super keyword refers to the parent class. It is used to call the constructor of the parent class and to access the parent's properties and methods.    |
| this  | The JavaScript this keyword refers to the object it belongs to. ... Alone, this refers to the global object. I    |
| Test Driven Development (TDD)| Image result for Test Driven Development (TDD)In layman's terms, Test Driven Development (TDD) is a software development practice that focuses on creating unit test cases before developing the actual code. It is an iterative approach that combines programming,    |
| jest  | Jest is a JavaScript testing framework designed to ensure correctness of any JavaScript codebase. It allows you to write tests with an approachable, familiar and feature-rich API that gives you results quickly.    |
| Continuous Integration (CI)| Continuous integration (CI) is the practice of automating the integration of code changes from multiple contributors into a single software project. It's a primary DevOps best practice, allowing developers to frequently merge code changes into a central repository where builds and tests then run.    |
| REST  | A REST API (also known as RESTful API) is an application programming interface (API or web API) that conforms to the constraints of REST architectural style and allows for interaction with RESTful web services.    |
| Data Model| A data model (or datamodel) is an abstract model that organizes elements of data and standardizes how they relate to one another and to the properties of real-world entities    |
