## Simplified Definitions

### Array.map()

> its that function we use it to call one time to every element in the array , and its creating a new array 


### Array.reduce()

> The reduce() method executes a reducer function (that you provide) on each element of the array, resulting in a single output value.


### superagent()

> SuperAgent is light-weight progressive ajax API crafted for flexibility, readability, and a low learning 

### .then()
> The then() method returns a Promise. It takes up to two arguments: callback functions for the success and failure cases of the Promise.

### async / await

> An async function is a function declared with the async keyword, and the await keyword is permitted within them. The async and await keywords enable asynchronous, promise-based behavior to be written in a cleaner style, avoiding the need to explicitly configure promise chains.

## is callback functions considered to be Asynchronous?

>  callback doesn't make a function asynchronous because  It iterates over each item and calls the function once per item.
