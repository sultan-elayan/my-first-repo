# AWS: Cloud Servers 

## Describe the Web-Request-Response-Cycle

> 
The messages sent by the client, usually a Web browser, are called requests and the messages sent by the server as an answer are called responses

## Explain what a “server” is, as it relates to the WRRC

> A server is a computer program or device that provides a service to another computer program and its user, also known as the client. In a data center, the physical computer that a server program runs on is also frequently referred to as a server. That machine might be a dedicated server or it might be used for other purposes.

## What does it mean to “deploy” an application?

>
Application Deployment (also referred to as Software Deployment) is the process of installing, configuring, and enabling a specific application or set of applications, usually through an application manager (app manager) or software management system, to a specific URL on a server.
