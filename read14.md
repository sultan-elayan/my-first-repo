# Trees 

> A tree is a nonlinear data structure, compared to arrays, linked lists, stacks and queues which are linear data structures. A tree can be empty with no nodes or a tree is a structure consisting of one node called the root and zero or one or more subtrees.

>  Trees can be used to store data that has an inherent hierarchical structure. For example, an operating system may use a tree for directories, files and folders in its file management system. They are dynamic, which means that it is easy to add and delete nodes

## Binary Trees

> A binary tree is a tree-type non-linear data structure with a maximum of two children for each parent. Every node in a binary tree has a left and right reference along with the data element. ... The nodes that hold other sub-nodes are the parent nodes.

## Binary Search Trees

> A Binary Search Tree (BST) is a tree in which all the nodes follow the below-mentioned properties âˆ’ The value of the key of the left sub-tree is less than the value of its parent (root) node's key. The value of the key of the right sub-tree is greater than or equal to the value of its parent (root) node's key.

##  K-ary Trees

> K-ary trees are trees whose internal nodes all have exactly K children. Thus, a full binary tree is a 2-ary tree. The PR Quadtree discussed in Module <Spatial> is an example of a 4-ary tree. Because K-ary tree nodes have a fixed number of children, unlike general trees, they are relatively easy to implement.
