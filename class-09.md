# Forms and JS Events
## Forms
> HTML borrows the concept of a form to refer to different
elements that allow you to collect information from visitors to
your site.

### Why Forms?
> The best known form on the web is probably
the search box that sits right in the middle of
Google's homepage.

allows you to control the shape

known as a marker)._

_You can specify an image to act
as a bullet point using the
list-style-image property._

### list-style-position
_Lists are indented into the page
by default and the list-styleposition
property indicates
whether the marker should
appear on the inside or the
outside of the box containing the
main points._

### empty-cells
_If you have empty cells in
your table, then you can use
the empty-cells property to
specify whether or not their
borders should be shown._

### cursor
_The cursor property allows
you to control the type of mouse
cursor that should be displayed
to users._

## Events
> When you browse the web, your browser registers different
types of events. It's the browser's way of saying, "Hey, this
just happened." Your script can then respond to these events.
