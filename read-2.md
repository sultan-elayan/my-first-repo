## What’s the difference between PUT and PATCH?
![](https://www.devopsschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/put-vs-post-patch.jpg)

> The main difference between the PUT and PATCH method is that the PUT method uses the request URI to supply a modified version of the requested resource which replaces the original version of the resource, whereas the PATCH method supplies a set of instructions to modify the resource

## Provide links to 3 services or tools that allow you to “mock” an API for development like json-server

1.  Mockoon
2.  Mocky.io
3.  Mockable.io

## Compare and contrast Swagger and APIDoc.js 1 Which HTTP status codes should be sent with each type of (un)successful API call? 

> in Swagger - the Swagger Inspector Extension can get around many errors you could have, especially CORS (cross origin resource sharing) issues. You should be prompted to download the extension

> in APIDoc.js Status and error codes refer to a code number in the response header that indicates the general classification of the response — for example, whether the request was successful (200), resulted in a server error (500), had authorization issues (403)

## Compare and contrast SOAP and ReST

> SOAP is a protocol, and REST is an architectural style
- REST is all about simplicity, thanks to HTTP protocols.
- SOAP has tighter security. WS-Security, in addition to SSL support
- REST APIs use a single uniform interface. This simplifies how applications interact with the API by requiring they all interface in the same way
- Successful/retry logic for reliable messaging functionality. Rest doesn’t have a standard messaging system and can only address communication failures by retrying.

###  NodeJS and Express

> open-source, cross-platform runtime environment that allows developers to create all kinds of server-side tools and applications in JavaScript.

> Express is the most popular Node web framework, and is the underlying library for a number of other popular Node web frameworks


### npm 
> npm is a package manager for the JavaScript programming language maintained by npm, Inc. npm is the default package manager for the JavaScript runtime environment Node.js. It consists of a command line client, also called npm, and an online database of public and paid-for private packages, called the npm registry

### What is TDD?
> “Test-driven development” refers to a style of programming in which three activities are tightly interwoven: coding, testing (in the form of writing unit tests) and design (in the form of refactoring).

### CI/CD
> The CI/CD pipeline is one of the best practices for devops teams to implement, for delivering code changes more frequently and reliably
