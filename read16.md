# AWS: S3 and Lambda

- Describe “The Cloud”

>  Cloud computing is the delivery of different services through the Internet, including data storage, servers, databases, networking, and software. Cloud-based storage makes it possible to save files to a remote database and retrieve them on demand.

 - What is a container (as it relates to computers and servers)?

 > Containers are a form of operating system virtualization. A single container might be used to run anything from a small microservice or software process to a larger application. ... Compared to server or machine virtualization approaches, however, containers do not contain operating system images.

- What is auto-scaling?

> Autoscaling is a cloud computing feature that enables organizations to scale cloud services such as server capacities or virtual machines up or down automatically, based on defined situations such as traffic ir utilization levels

- What is bandwidth?

> The maximum amount of data transmitted over an internet connection in a given amount of time. Bandwidth is often mistaken for internet speed when it's actually the volume of information that can be sent over a connection in a measured amount of time – calculated in megabits per second (Mbps).

- How do cloud providers compute service costs?

> Pricing is usually based on a per-gigabyte monthly rate, along with any applicable charges for network egress and API requests — but it can get more complicated depending on the service and vendor. With some cloud providers, for example, the price per gigabyte decreases as your overall storage usage increases

- Server Instances:A server instance is a collection of SQL Server databases which are run by a solitary SQL Server service or instance. The details of each server instance can be viewed on the service console which can be web-based or command-line based.

- Containers : Containers are a form of operating system virtualization. A single container might be used to run anything from a small microservice or software process to a larger application. Inside a container are all the necessary executables, binary code, libraries, and configuration files.

- Cloud Services : The term "cloud services" refers to a wide range of services delivered on demand to companies and customers over the internet. These services are designed to provide easy, affordable access to applications and resources, without the need for internal infrastructure or hardware.

- Cloud Architecture: Cloud architecture is the way technology components combine to build a cloud, in which resources are pooled through virtualization technology and shared across a network. The components of a cloud architecture include: A front-end platform (the client or device used to access the cloud) ... A cloud-based delivery model.

- AWS: As the lead cloud computing platform, Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the primary profit driver for Amazon. AWS provides servers, storage, networking, remote computing, email, mobile development, and security. AWS accounts for about 13% of Amazon's total revenue as of Q2 2021.

## AWS S3

> 
Amazon S3 provides object (file) storage through a web interface. It's built to store, protect and retrieve data from “buckets” at any time from anywhere on any device. As AWS describes it, an S3 environment is a flat structure.

## What is Serverless?

Serverless is a term that generally refers to serverless applications. Serverless applications are ones that don’t need any server provision and do not require to manage servers.

## What is AWS Lambda?

AWS Lambda is a serverless computing service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). Users of AWS Lambda create functions, self-contained applications written in one of the supported languages and runtimes, and upload them to AWS Lambda, which executes those functions in an efficient and flexible manner.
