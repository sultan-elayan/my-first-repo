#  Component Based UI 

## Name 5 Javascript UI Frameworks (other than React)

1. Node.js
2. Vue.js
3. AngularJS
4. Ember.js
5. Next. js

## What’s the difference between a framework and a library?

> A library performs specific, well-defined operations.

>  framework is a skeleton where the application defines the "meat" of the operation by filling out the skeleton. The skeleton still has code to link up the parts but the most important work is done by the application.

- Rendering: it generates markup from templates and data from a database or an API. This markup is then sent to the client to update the DOM and paint pixels to the screen
- Templates : Javascript Templates are HTML web pages that execute Embedded Javascript on the server
- State: State is a plain JavaScript object used by React to represent an information about the component's current situation.

## What is JSX ?

> JSX stands for JavaScript XML. It is simply a syntax extension of JavaScript. It allows us to directly write HTML in React (within JavaScript code) 

> It is faster than normal JavaScript as it performs optimizations while translating to regular JavaScript. 

## Advantages of JSX:

- JSX makes it easier to write or add HTML in React.
- JSX can easily convert HTML tags to react elements.
- It is faster than regular JavaScript.
- JSX allows us to put HTML elements in DOM without using appendChild() or createElement() method.
- As JSX is an expression, we can use it inside of if statements and for loops, assign it to variables, accept it as arguments, or return it from functions.
- JSX prevents XSS (cross-site-scripting) attacks popularly known as injection attacks.
- It is type-safe, and most of the errors can be found at compilation time.

## What is Sass ?

> Sass is a stylesheet language that’s compiled to CSS. It allows you to use variables, nested rules, mixins, functions, and more, all with a fully CSS-compatible syntax. Sass helps keep large stylesheets well-organized and makes it easy to share design within and across projects.
