# How Does a Computer Work?
> A computer is a machine composed of hardware and software components. A computer receives data through an input unit based on the instructions it is given and after it processes the data

##  What Makes a Computer, a Computer?
> The most basic way of thinking of a computer is as an Input/Output machine. That’s a pretty basic idea: computers take information from external sources (your keyboard, mouse, sensors or the internet), store it, process it, and return the result (Output) of that process. By the way, if you think about it, the moment computers are connected through the internet there’s an ever ending loop of inputs and outputs as the output of a computer (say a website) becomes the input of another and so forth(!!).

## Binary & Data
> Binary and Switches. Binary is a mathematical number system: a way of counting. We have all learned to count using ten digits: 0-9. One probable reason is that we have ten fingers to represent numbers. The computer has switches to represent data and switches have only two states: ON and OFF. Binary has two digits to do the counting: 0 and 1 - a natural fit to the two states of a switch (0 = OFF, 1 = ON)

## Hardware and Software
> Computer hardware is any physical device used in or with your machine, whereas software is a collection of codes installed onto your computer's hard drive. For instance, the computer monitor you're currently using to read this text and the mouse you're using to navigate this web page is computer hardware.
