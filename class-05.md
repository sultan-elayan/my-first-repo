# HTML Images; CSS Color & Text
## HTML Images
> There are many reasons why you might
want to add an image to a web page: you
might want to include a logo, photograph,
illustration, diagram, or chart.

### Adding Images
> To add an image into the page
you need to use an (img)
element. This is an empty
element (which means there is
no closing tag). It must carry the
following two attributes:

### 1. src 
_This tells the browser where
it can find the image file._

### 2. alt
_This provides a text description
of the image which describes the
image if you cannot see it._

### Height & Width of Images
> You will also often see an (img)
element use two other attributes
that specify its size:

### 1. height 
_This specifies the height of the
image in pixels._

### 2. width
_This specifies the width of the
image in pixels._

2. inside the start of a paragraph

## CSS Color
> Colors are specified using predefined color names, or RGB, HEX, HSL, RGBA, HSLA values.

_Color Tag In CSS_

### 1. Foreground Color
> by useing (color)

### 2. Background Color
> by useing (background-color)

_The color property allows you
to specify the color of text inside
an element or background . You can specify any
color in CSS in one of three ways:_

1. rgb values
> These express colors in terms
of how much red, green and
blue are used to make it up. For
example: rgb(100,100,90)

2. hex codes
> These are six-digit codes that
represent the amount of red,
green and blue in a color,
preceded by a pound or hash #
sign. For example: #ee3e80

3. hsl color
> The hsl color property has
been introduced in CSS3 as an
alternative way to specify colors.
The value of the property starts
with the letters hsl, followed
by individual values inside
parentheses

> There are 147 predefined color
names that are recognized
by browsers. For example:

## CSS Text
> text can be split into
two groups:

- ### Those that directly affect the font and its appearance (including the typeface, whether it is regular, bold or italic,and the size of the text)

- ### Those that would have the same effect on text no matter what font you were using (including the color of text and the spacing between words and letters)

### Specifying Typefaces
#### font-family
> The font-family property
allows you to specify the
typeface that should be used for
any text inside the element(s) to
which a CSS rule applies.

### text-align
> The text-align property allows
you to control the alignment of
text.

1. left This indicates that the text
should be left-aligned.
2. right This indicates that the text
should be right-aligned.
3. center This allows you to center text.
4. justify This indicates that every line in
a paragraph, except the last line,
should be set to take up the full
width of the containing box.
