# Want to Become a Programmer? The Truth Behind 3 Common Myths
- Myth 1: I need to be a prodigy to be a developer
> People often think programmers are a special breed of humanity, born with scientific calculators for brains. On the contrary, developers are ordinary people who simply have a passion for programming. And like in any profession, talent only gets people so far, as work ethic and discipline truly determine success or failure. If you’re curious to learn programming, don’t worry; it’s not as difficult as it may seem. At its core, programming is simply a form of communication between two entities — in this case, a developer and a computer. At a fundamental level, your task as a developer is to give instructions to a computer on how to build something, such as a website. But of course you don’t simply say, “Computer, build me a website.” It’s more complex than that. In a nutshell, programming is like writing meticulous instruction manuals in a special language, which only computers and other programmers can interpret. If you know how to communicate with others, you can learn to program.

- Myth 2: It’s too late for me to become a developer
>  The truth is it’s never too late to become a computer programmer. Lots of coding bootcamps work with students of all ages and from a wide variety of backgrounds. Many enroll with little programming experience. As long as they put in the required work, they’re able to find great success, both in the classroom and in the workforce after graduation. Even though you may be starting your career in programming later than you would have wished, you’ll find that you have everything you need to succeed with the right preparation and work ethic.

- Myth 3: I need a Computer Science degree to become a developer
> Have you noticed all the coding bootcamps popping up around the world? These bootcamps wouldn't stay in business long if they weren't succeeding as viable alternatives to conventional schools. (Disclaimer: I work for one.) Every month, graduates of these bootcamps — who often begin the camps with limited experience in programming — land jobs as developers. And if you throw in the increasing popularity of free online learning platforms like Codecademy, it’s evident that learning to program is not an opportunity exclusive to formal institutions
