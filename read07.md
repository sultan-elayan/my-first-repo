to specify the color of text inside
an element or background . You can specify any
color in CSS in one of three ways:_

1. rgb values
> These express colors in terms
of how much red, green and
blue are used to make it up. For
example: rgb(100,100,90)

2. hex codes
> These are six-digit codes that
represent the amount of red,
green and blue in a color,
preceded by a pound or hash #
sign. For example: #ee3e80

3.color names
> There are 147 predefined color
names that are recognized
by browsers. For example:
