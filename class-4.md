# React and Forms

## React Docs - Forms
> HTML form elements work a bit differently from other DOM elements in React, because form elements naturally keep some internal state.

### Controlled Components
> We can combine the two by making the React state be the “single source of truth”. Then the React component that renders a form also controls what happens in that form on subsequent user input. An input form element whose value is controlled by React in this way is called a “controlled component”.
### The textarea Tag
> In HTML, a (textarea) element defines its text by its children.

### The select Tag
> In HTML, (select) creates a drop-down list. For example, this HTML creates a drop-down list of flavors

## Alternatives to Controlled Components
> It can sometimes be tedious to use controlled components, because you need to write an event handler for every way your data can change and pipe all of the input state through a React component. This can become particularly annoying when you are converting a preexisting codebase to React, or integrating a React application with a non-React library. In these situations, you might want to check out uncontrolled components, an alternative technique for implementing input forms.

## The Conditional (Ternary) Operator Explained
> Starting With the Basics — The if statement
Using a conditional, like an if statement, allows us to specify that a certain block of code should be executed if a certain condition is met.

### Here’s what you need to know:
- The condition is what you’re actually testing. The result of your condition should be true or false or at least coerce to either boolean value.
- A ? separates our conditional from our true value. Anything between the ? and the : is what is executed if the condition evaluates to true.
- Finally a : colon. If your condition evaluates to false, any code after the colon is executed.
